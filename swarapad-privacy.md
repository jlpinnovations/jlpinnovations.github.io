**Last updated:** December 19, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes the policies and procedures on the collection, use, and disclosure of information when you use the SwaraPad mobile application (the "Service") operated by JLP Innovations ("we," "us," or "our").

We respect your privacy. This policy explains how we handle your data, particularly regarding the third-party advertising services we use.

## Information Collection and Use

**We (the developer) do not knowingly collect, store, or share any of your Personal Identifiable Information (PII) directly.** We do not require you to create an account, register, or provide your name/email to use the Service.

However, the app does use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you or your device for the purpose of serving advertisements and analyzing app performance.

### Third-Party Services (Google AdMob)
We use **Google AdMob** to display advertisements within the app. Google may use the advertising ID from your device (such as the Apple IDFA) to generate interests and demographics (for example, "sports enthusiasts") to serve ads that are relevant to you.

* **Google AdMob:** This service is provided by Google Inc.
* Google uses cookies and/or unique device identifiers to personalize ads for you.
* You can learn more about how Google uses your data here: [Google Privacy & Terms](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites).

### Log Data
We want to inform you that whenever you use our Service, in a case of an error in the app, we (via third-party products like Apple or Google) may collect data and information (through third-party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing our Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.

## Cookies and Tracking Technologies
The Service does not use "cookies" explicitly. However, the app may use third-party code and libraries (specifically Google AdMob) that use "cookies" or unique identifiers to collect information and improve their services.

## California Privacy Rights (CCPA/CPRA)
If you are a resident of California, you have specific rights regarding your personal information.

* **Right to Opt-Out:** You have the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information. 
    * *Note:* As we do not collect data directly, we do not sell your data. However, Google AdMob may use data for personalized ads. You can limit this via your iOS device settings (Settings > Privacy > Tracking).

## Children’s Privacy
Our Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us.
